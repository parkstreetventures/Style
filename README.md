# Style2Vec

Implementation of fashion products vector representation based on [Style2Vec: Representation Learning for Fashion Items from Style Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04014).
> Based on the intuition of distributional semantics used in word embeddings, Style2Vec learns the representation of a fashion item using other items in matching outfits as context. Two different convolutional neural networks are trained to maximize the probability of item co-occurrences.

## Docs
- [Report](docs/Report.md)

## Data Sources
- [Polyvore Dataset](https://github.com/xthan/polyvore-dataset) was used for model training.
- [DeepFashion: Attribute Prediction](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/AttributePrediction.html) was used for model evaluation

### Requirements
- Tensorflow > 1.14
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
- scipy
- pandas

## Results
Sequence of nearest neighbors from Style2Vec embedding on each line:
